      <p>
        I have worked in the food service industry for over 20 years! I studied
        EECE at Ohio University; however, I pursued the excitement and passion
        of the food world. Now that my body is older, the industry is taking its
        toll. So I'm breaking back into the tech world and looking to hit the
        ground running. I'm eager to meet new people and share some experiences
        together!

          <p>In this project, we developed a console application that would allow the user to create and interact
            with both Organic and Robotic Dragons that can either Breath Fire or Blow Bitter Wind. These dragons
            are housed in a virtual cave that would have ash build up from the fire breathing dragons and icicles from
            the
            icy dragons. However, the fire breathing dragons would melt the iciles while the bitter wind from the icy
            dragons would clear out some of the ashes. Future iterations of this application will allow the user to
            return to their previously saved state upon loading the application, and managing multiple dragon caves
            to illicit inter-dragon activities.

          <p>In this project, we were tasked to develop a console application that would allow a user to
            enter data for an Employee Roster to keep track of the staff of a clinic. We also added the features
            of entering additional patients (default starting with 3 patients), sending Doctors and Nurses on
            their rounds having a direct effect on the patients' health levels. Future iterations of this application
            will include a time feature that will effect the patient's health levels, and will allow the user to send
            janitors on their rounds to maintain the hospital's cleanliness.
